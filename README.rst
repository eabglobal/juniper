Juniper: Tool to package lambda functions
=========================================

Juniper is a packaging tool with a with a single purpose in mind: stream and standardize
the creation of a zip artifact for a set of AWS Lambda functions.

Packaging of python lambda functions is a problem a web developer faces when
building web APIs using AWS services. The main issue is that the dependencies
of the function must be included along with the business logic of the function.

::
    This tool does not deploy or update a lambda function in AWS. This
    tool is used to generate a set of .zip files contaning dependencies and
    shared libraries, which you can use to deploy a lambda function.

Quickstart
**********

With Python==3.6 and Docker installed, install juniper:

    >>> git clone git@github.com:eabglobal/juniper.git
    >>> cd juniper
    >>> pip install -e .

Go to the code you are packaging and define a configuration for your
functions, ex in `manifest.yml`:

.. code:: yaml

    functions:
    router:                                         # Name of the lambda function (result in router.zip artifact)
        requirements: ./src/router/requirements.txt.  # Path to reqs file
        include:
        - ./src/commonlib/mylib                     # Path for inclusion in code
        - ./src/router_function/router.             # Path for inclusion in code


Build it!

    >>> juni build

Your .zip is now in the `dist/` directory.  ðŸŽ‰
